    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Definitely use very large shrimp for this shrimp oreganata recipe. Think
      shrimp scampi meets a crunchy baked Parmesan topping. You can serve them
      as an appetizer, on top of cooked pasta with extra lemon-butter sauce, or
      simply with some grilled bread and flavorful olive oil to dip in.
